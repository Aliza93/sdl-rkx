> CocoaPods 1.0.0+ is required to build sdl-rkx 0.1.0+.

To integrate sdl-rkx into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '9.0'
use_frameworks!

pod 'sdl-rkx', '~> 0.1'
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

> NOTE: When building ResearchKit, you may need to set 'No Common Blocks' to 'No' under the Apple LLVM Code Generation heading in the ResearchKit framework Build Settings
